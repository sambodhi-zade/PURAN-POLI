INGREDIENTS 

1. For the dough – The dough of puran poli is prepared with whole wheat flour, salt, water, and ghee. The addition of ghee makes the poli nice, flaky and soft. You can also replace some whole wheat flour with all-purpose flour to make it flakier.

2. For the stuffing – The sweet and yummy stuffing inside is made with cooked chana dal, jaggery, and ghee. Yes, just three main ingredients.

Try to use organic jaggery. It might look dark in color but it is free of many harmful chemicals that are used to bleach jaggery to give it a light color.

3. The filling is flavored with nutmeg powder, and cardamom powder, which enhances the taste of poli even more and also lends it a beautiful aroma. Some people also add ground ginger and ground fennel seeds to the filling.

4. You can even add dry grated coconut in this mixture, as done in some of the Konkan regions. 

Some people even use tuvar dal (yellow pigeon peas lentils) to make puran poli. You can also experiment and use any other dal for the same. But I feel among all the dals, chana dal and tuvar dal tastes the best.
